RCL Argos Data - Processing and File Formats
***************************************************************************************

Argos data are placed on the GNS Ftp server by the Argos data centre and automatically 
FTP'd to Tarawera by the 'Get Argos' script (/home/volcano/programs/rcl_argos/get_argos.sh). 
Downloaded raw files are placed in: 
   /home/volcano/data/rcl_argos/raw

The data processing script generates daily 'clean' files, which are placed in:
   /home/volcano/data/rcl_argos/clean

Clean files are filed by year and month. 

A concatenated 'clean' file is created containing the most recent 120 days of data, 
which is used to generate high resolution plots. (clean.csv) 

An daily average file is also maintained. (rcl_daily_avg.csv)



=======================================================================================
Processing Steps: 
=======================================================================================

The data processing script chain is as follows 
(scripts located in /home/volcano/programs/rcl_argos):

Cron (Daily @ 08:00)
  |
  -->get_argos.sh
       |
       |-- Get raw argos files via FTP
       |
       |--> extract_argos.sh
       |      |
       |      -->argos_cleanup.pl (Perl)
       |
       |--> make_tilt.sh
       |
       |--> update_daily_average.sh
       |
       |-- Add daily data to 120 day clean file
       |
       |-- Copy daily average file to web server
       |
       ---> plot_argos.csh
              |
              ---> plot_rclargos.sh



 1: FTP Download:                                             

  Run an FTP command sequence to retrieve the latest Argos files.
  Files are deleted from FTP server after retrieval.          

 2: Generate 'Clean' Files:                                             
                                                              
  For the most recent 6 days, the script searches for and 
  extracts data from the raw files, and generates new daily 
  'clean' files. 

  Data arrive as 16-bit unsigned integers; in fact, the values are 
  actually in Campbell Scientific FP2 format. 

  The values are extracted and coverted to floating point numbers. 
  The checksum is used to remove bad records. 

  Actual decode / clean is done by calling "extract_argos.sh"
  for each date. See extract_argos.sh for additional notes. 

 3: Generate Tilt Data Files: 

  For the most recent 6 days, the daily tilt file is updated 
  by calling "make_tilt.sh" for the day. 
  This script extracts the required tilt columns from the 
  clean files, and converts the date format.

 4: Daily Average Update: 

  For the most recent 6 days, the daily average file is updated
  by calling "update_daily_average.sh" for the day. 
  This script uses awk to calculate daily averages. See
  update_daily_average.sh for more details. 
                                                              
 5: Add data to 120 day clean file: 

  For days from 120 to 7 days ago, the script assumes that
  clean data have already been extracted; data for these days 
  are simply extracted from any existing daily 'clean' files in 
  /home/volcano/data/rcl_argos/clean and appended to a new 
  120-day clean file (clean.csv) which is used to generate 
  the plots. This ensures the 120-day file is up-to-date.

 6: Copy Daily Average File to Web Sever

 7: Draw Plots (also copies plots to web server)                                             





=======================================================================================
"Clean" file format: 
=======================================================================================

The following fields are stored in "clean" files:

RecordDate,
Battery,
PanelTemp,
DepthKTE,
LakeTemp,
AtmPressure,
EastTilt,
NorthTilt,
TiltBatt,
DepthKTEMin,
DepthKTEMax,
DepthKTEStdDev,
DepthRTO


Note that the 'RecordDate' is the Date/Time the data were recorded on the logger (UTC), 
reconstructed using the 'Receive Date/Time' and the 'Interval No'. 'Receive Date/Time' is the
UTC Date/Time that the data were received by the Argos data centre. 




=======================================================================================
Daily Averages File: 
=======================================================================================

The daily average file contains the following data columns: 

DateTime,Battery,PanelTemp,LakeDepth,LakeTemp,AtmPressure,RecordCount

RecordCount is the number of records recieved for the day (proxy for snow 
burial depth!). 

Note that records prior to 13-Apr-2011 represent NZST days, while records after 
13-Apr-2011 represent UTC days. 




=======================================================================================
Argos raw data file formats:
=======================================================================================

The data fields transmitted by the Argos (i.e. the fields in the raw files) have changed 
several times. File formats are summaried below: 


15-Apr-2009 to 14-Apr-2010:
---------------------------

Eg: 
"94061,NN,2009/04/15 03:36:44,1,13.09,22.22,0.282,29.25,1.606"

Fields: 
ID, 
Satellite, 
Recieve Date/Time, 
Compression, 
Battery (Volts), 
Logger Temp (deg C), 
Lake Depth KTE (m), 
Lake Temp (Deg C), 
Lake Depth RTO (m)

NOTE: 'Lake Depth RTO' was derived from the RTO sensor, and was not very reliable. 



14-Apr-2010 to 19-May-2010:
---------------------------

Eg:
"94061,K,2010/04/13 15:54:08,3,12.57,3.42,0.578,20.07,723.95,250,0.166,0.009,0.004,0.001,0,0.001,0.003,15,295.6"

Fields: 
ID, 
Satellite, 
Recieve Date/Time, 
Compression, 
Battery (Volts), 
Logger Temp (deg C), 
Lake Depth KTE (m), 
Lake Temp (Deg C), 
Atmospheric Pressure (mV),
Hydrophone Scale Range (mV),
Hydrophone fft 1-3 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 3-5 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 5-10 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 10-30 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 30-100 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 100-300 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 300-1000 Hz,
Interval No, 
CheckSum

NOTES: 
Atmospheric Pressure was recorded in the logger cabinet. Values were transmitted in mV (raw sensor reading) 
but converted to mBar in clean.csv by the processing script for convenient display on plots (mBar = mV x 82.7371). 

'Interval No' refers to 15 minute interval of the day when the data were recorded (logger time), where 
Midnight NZST = 0, 00:15 NZST = 1, 00:30 NZST = 2, etc. 

'Checksum' is the sum of fields from 'Battery Voltage' through to the last Hydrophone fft value 
(doesn't include the 'Interval No'). Note the atmospheric pressure reading used to calculate the CheckSum 
is the original sensor reading in mV (divide the mBar value by 82.7371). 


19-May-2010 to 13-Apr-2011:
---------------------------

Eg:
"94061,P,2010/05/20 01:27:03,2,0.539,21.82,13.4,10.66,0,0.138,0.017,0.005,0.001,0.001,0,0,13.05,53,64.93"


Fields: 
ID, 
Satellite, 
Recieve Date/Time, 
Compression, 
Lake Depth KTE (m), 
Lake Temp (Deg C), 
Logger Temp (deg C), 
Atmospheric Pressure (mBar),
Hydrophone Scale Range (0 or 1),
Hydrophone fft 1-3 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 3-5 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 5-10 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 10-30 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 30-100 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 100-300 Hz,
Hydrophone fft 300-1000 Hz,
Battery (Volts), 
Interval No, 
CheckSum



NOTES: 

Atmospheric Pressure was recorded in the logger cabinet. Values were transmitted in PSI (raw sensor reading) 
but converted to mBar in clean.csv by the processing script for convenient display on plots (mBar = PSI x 68.9475).

'Hydrophone Scale Range' is stored as 0 or 1; 0=250 mv, 1 = 2500 mV.

'Interval No' refers to 15 minute interval of the day when the data were recorded (logger time), where 
Midnight NZST = 0, 00:15 NZST = 1, 00:30 NZST = 2, etc. 

'Checksum' is the sum of fields from 'Lake Depth KTE', including 'Battery' and 'Interval No'. 'Interval No' 
is divided by 10 when added to the Checksum, to ensure all values are in similar order of magnitude. 
Note the atmospheric pressure reading used to calculate the CheckSum is in units of psi
(divide the mBar value by 68.9475). 

FFT Results for the bands at 30Hz, 100Hz and 300Hz are multiplied by 10 on the logger to improve resolution. 



13-Apr-2011 - on:
---------------------------


Fields: 
ID, 
Satellite, 
Recieve Date/Time, 
Compression, 
Lake Depth KTE (m), 
Lake Temp (Deg C), 
Logger Temp (deg C), 
Atmospheric Pressure (PSI),
East Tilt (uRad),
North Tilt (uRad),
Tilt Battery (volts),
Minimum Lake Depth KTE (m),
Maximum Lake Depth KTE (m),  
Std Dev Lake Depth KTE (m), 
Lake Depth RTO (PSI), 
Battery (Volts), 
Interval No, 
CheckSum

NOTES: 

Logger time is UTC from 13-Apr-2011 onwards. 

Atmospheric Pressure was recorded in the logger cabinet. Values were transmitted in PSI (raw sensor reading) 
but converted to mBar in clean.csv by the processing script for convenient display on plots (mBar = PSI x 68.9475).

RTO lake depth was recorded by the RTO pressure sensor in the lake and transmitted in PSI. Atmospheric pressure 
recorded by the RTO sensor in the cabinet must be subtracted. The RTO pressure values are converted to m lake 
depth by the processing script (assuming fresh water for the water density). 

'Interval No' refers to 15 minute interval of the day when the data were recorded (logger time), where 
Midnight UTC = 0, 00:15 = 1, 00:30 = 2, etc. 

'Checksum' is the sum of fields from 'Lake Depth KTE', including 'Battery' and 'Interval No'. 

The E and N Tilt values are divided by 1000, while the 'Interval No' is divided by 10, when
adding these values to the Checksum. Note the atmospheric pressure and lake level RTO pressure readings
used to calculate the CheckSum is in units of psi (divide the mBar value by 68.9475).

CHECKSUM / TILT FAILURE: 
The tilt meter logger stopped sending data on 13-May-2011, causing checksum value on main logger to change to 
'NAN' (value -8190). Logger was reprogrammed on 21-Jun-2011 to restore checksum, and tilt logger was 
restarted. Tilt logger stopped again on 27-Jun-2011, and all tilt values went to 0.00 (checksum still OK).
